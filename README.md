A showcase e-commerce website with payment method

Go **[here](https://secret-ridge-23194.herokuapp.com/)** for live demo.

This is a good example of a basic e-market website developed entirely on NodeJS. We use the ExpressJS framework and ejs templates for the views.
The product listing is hard-coded in the back-end index.js file.
