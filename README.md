A showcase e-commerce website with payment method

Go **[here](https://secret-ridge-23194.herokuapp.com/)** for live demo.

This is a good example of a basic e-market website developed entirely on NodeJS. We use the ExpressJS framework and ejs templates for the views.
The product listing is hard-coded in the back-end index.js file.
The are two ejs templates (index.ejs and shop.ejs).

For styling and layout I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), the payment method is done with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/fr), which is very dev-friendly and easy to configure. I strrongly recommend for beginners like me!
